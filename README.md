# Snake_Game
# Overview
This project is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using the Turtle graphics library in Python. The game involves controlling a snake to eat food and grow longer, while avoiding collisions with the game borders and the snake's own body.

# Features
Snake head controlled by arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right).
Snake grows longer upon eating food.
Game ends if the snake collides with the borders or itself.
Score is displayed, including the high score achieved in a session.
# How to Play
Run the Python script (snake_game.py).
Use the arrow keys (W, S, A, D) to control the snake's direction.
Eat the red food to grow longer and increase your score.
Avoid collisions with the borders and the snake's body.
Try to achieve the highest score possible.
Dependencies
Python 3.x
Turtle graphics library
Controls
W: Move the snake up
